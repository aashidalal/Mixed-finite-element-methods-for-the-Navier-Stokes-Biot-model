Abstract. We present two mixed finite element methods for the quasistatic Navier–Stokes–Biot model. The methods are based on a fully
mixed formulation, using pseudostress, velocity, and vorticity for Navier-Stokes, stress, displacement, and rotation for elasticity, and velocity
and pressure for Darcy flow. To handle the advective term, augmenting Galerkin-type terms are introduced in the Navier–Stokes model in
the first method, while the second method uses a Banach space formulation. We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of the two
methods and illustrate their behavior with numerical experiments.

Keywords: Navier–Stokes–Biot, Mixed finite elements, Banach space, Augmented formulation.
